        p We are a group of Engineering students from Bengaluru. This project was developed with the aim of satisfying the rapidly increasing need for essential services like beds, oxygen cylinders, etc. 
        p We, as budding engineers want to contribute and help the people in need during this grave pandemic.
        p We appreciate the efforts of all the volunteers participating in this project and expect them to avoid any misinformation.
